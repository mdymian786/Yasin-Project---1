        What are the advantages of using JavaScript
        1. Form validation can be done on the client side, which reduces the unnecessary round trips between 
            the client and the server. This also means the load on the server is reduced and the application is 
            more responsive.
        2. JavaScript uses the client machine processing power.
        3. With JavaScript partial page updates are possible i.e only portions of the page can be updated, 
            without reloading the entire web form. This is commonly called as AJAX.
        4. JavaScript can also be used to animate elements on a page. For example, show or hide elements 
            and sections of the page.
            
            There are two main disadvantages of JavaScript. 
                1. Security : JavaScript runs on the client machine. So a malicious user may use Javascript to do 
                    a variety of things like tracking your browsing history, stealing passwords etc. 
                    This is one of the main reasons why people disable JavaScript.

                2. Browser Compatibility : Not all browsers treat the same piece of JavaScript in the same manner. 
                    This means the functionality and the user interface may vary from browser to browser. 
                    That is why cross-browser testing is very important. However, with JavaScript libraries like 
                    jQuery Browser Compatibility is no longer a major issue.

        alert("Hello");
        // document.getElementById("myTextBox").style.backgroundColor = "red";
        // above line will not work because script executes before textbox identified in browser DOM

        var a = "Bond 00";
        var b = 7;
        var c = a + b;

        //myvalue = getElementById("myTextBox").value;
        alert(c);

        function isEven() {
            var number1 = document.getElementById("myTextBox").value;
            var number = parseInt(number1);
            if (number % 2 == 0) {
                alert(number + " is Even");
            }
            else {
                alert(number + " is Odd");
            }
        }

        Advantages of external JavaScript over inline JavaScript 

        1.  Maintainability : JavaScript in external files can be referenced on multiple pages without having to 
            duplicate the code inline on every page. If something has to change, you only have one place to change. 
            So external JavaScript code can be reused and maintenance will be much easier.

        2. Separation of Concerns : Storing JavaScript in a separate external .js file adheres to Separation of 
            concerns design principle. In general it is a good practice to separate HTML, CSS and JavaScript as it 
            makes it easier working with them. Also allows multiple developers to work simultaneously.

        3. Performance : An external JavaScript file can be cached by the browser, where as an inline JavaScript 
            on the page is loaded every time the page loads.
